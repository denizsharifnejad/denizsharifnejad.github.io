 <p1>I'm an international student with a passion for finance. Originally coming from Iran.i began my educational journey by studying German language at the  Wien university in vienna. However, I soon discovered my interest in finance and decided to pursue further studies in business economics at a  York university in Toronto, Canada. During this time in Canada, I had the opportunity to join an internship at one of Canadaâ€™s leading banks, where I gained valuable experience as a financial analyst trainee. This experience allowed me to further develop my skills and set a solid Foundation for my professional career.Hopefully my dedication to my studies and my eagerness to learn Has positioned me as a promising professional in the field  of finance.<p1>
